<b>Introduction</b>

Welcome to this <b>README.md</b> repo! The purpose of making this project is to sharpen my coding skills.
In this file I will tell you about this animation, starting from the tools I use.


<b>Challenge</b>


My challenge is to make this Dark-mode Navigation Animated Button and make it look as close as possible to the design I've made in figma and uploaded to Dribbble, then as my portfolio on the front end developer
    Animation I made in this repository:
             <ul>
               <li>
                   Create a navigation tab bar according to the design I made in figma and upload it to dribble
               </li>
               <li>
                   If you click the button, it will slowly turn black, and vice versa
               </li>
            </ul>
               </li>
           </ul>

Click Design User Interface on Dribbble, I created a Dribbble Design using Figma
